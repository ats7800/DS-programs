// Root - has no parent
// children - has only one parent and may have many children
// parent - can have a parent and has chldren
// shibling - children of same parent
// leaf - no chlidren

// binary trees can have at most only two children
// complete binary tree has its all levels complete;y filled except possibly the last one and all nodes on last are as left as possible

// perfect binary tree
// height of an empty tree is -1; for one node its 0;
// height of pefect binary tree is = 2^(n+1) - 1;
// height = number of edges and not number of nodes; #nodes = height+1;
